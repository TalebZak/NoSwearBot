<h1 align="center">NoSwearBot</h1>

<p align="center">The NoSwearBot is a bot that is made to regulate chat in discord servers,
turning discord servers a safe place where they can't be bullied and people can't spread toxicity while reducing the amount of work that moderators should spend looking at chat.
This project allows admins to blacklist a word in the server to ban it, when said the message is deleted and a warning is sent to the sender and their infrigement count is incremented. Once the count exceeds a threshold set in the server, they get kicked.
Owners are able to delete blacklisted expressions as well and users can view the blacklisted expressions

# NoSwearBot
The NoSwearBot is a bot that is made to regulate chat in discord servers,
turning discord servers a safe place where they can't be bullied and people can't spread toxicity.
This project allows Discord to become a platform used for educational purposes. This project allows people to blacklist a word in the server to ban it, when said the message is deleted and a warning is sent to the sender(unless the channel is NSFW)
Owners are able to delete blacklisted words as well
## Learning outcomes
- Working with asynchronous functions in Python
- The understanding of string and pattern matching through the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
- Basic CRUD operations in Sqlite databases
- Working with Discord.py library and how to make a bot from scratch and discord commands
- The use of coroutines in Python
## Functions
- Blacklist a word
- Remove a word from blacklist
- Displaying the Server's blacklist
- Once sent, the message is checked by the bot, in case a blacklisted word exists a warning is sent to the author and the message is deleted
